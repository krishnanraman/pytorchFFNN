1 Simple GOAL:
Write a program in python to recognize a 2 digit number. I will write a 2 digit number with a pencil on a sheet of paper. I will then take a picture of the sheet of paper and upload it to my computer. The program must recognize the picture and convert it into English. For example, if the picture has the number 28 on it, the program must print "Twenty Eight" on screen.

2. Tools:    
a. Need a paper with 28 written on it, convert to a cellphone image as 28.jpg (TRIVIAL)    
b. Need a program that converts the jpg into bytes ( EASY, use OpenCV & Idx - SKIP as exercise for reader )    
c. Need a program that converts numbers into English (EASY)     
d. Need a program that recognizes an image as a number. (MODERATELY HARD)    

We focus mainly on 2c & 2d.    
Please do 2a & 2b by yourself.    

Simple Feed Forward Network in Pytorch.
1. Install Anaconda ( preferably from scratch.)
2. Install pytorch (pytorch.org )
3. Open a jupyter notebook & paste ffnn.py into notebook cells. Execute code.
4. (optional)Install idx_tools, opencv
